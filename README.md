# MC2Finance




To run the development server:


1. Run yarn       (To install node_modules)
2. Run npx cypress open     (To Run cypress)

We have the file;
1. "MC2FinanceToken.cy.js" that contains the validation for Functionality, Accessibility of Tokens as well as the Token Data Match  Validation

Note: Verifying the Token Data Match on Mobula failed as I couldnt access the Modula site due to CORS POLICY(probably security reasons)

2. "PriceAbbreviationCheck.cy.js" this contains the Price Abbreviation check validation
